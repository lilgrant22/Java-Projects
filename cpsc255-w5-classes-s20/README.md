
# Week 5 - Introduction to Classes and objects (instances)

We will start with correcting some `ProblematicCode` from exam.


We will then work with `SimpleStudent` and modify it in-class as we go.

I've given you most of `Student` class, but we need to add a bit.

We will then write StudentGradeBook together.
This will give us practice working with classes and handling some array issues 
in preparation for next week's lessons.


* Think through this carefully.
  * How many loops do you need?  (think before you ask!) 
* Do your design on paper before you start coding.
  * Recitation leaders and instructors will ask to see you paper design before answering questions,
    but they will help you with paper design
* Use your debugging techniques
   * Use break points and view variables.
   * Use print statements to track your progress through the code.
* Please, for the love of all that is good in the universe, START EARLY!


# Grading

* 100 pts due in WebCat by Tuesday 18-Feb by 11:59 PM

    * 80% of grade is based on correctness of the provided unit tests.
    * 20% based on style checking by WebCAT.

 WebCAT style can be picky, and some requirements are annoying; however,
 as professionals you will need to adapt to the style required by
 your work environment.

 For us, WebCAT sets the style, so adjust accordingly.
 I have fixed the cnu255 formatter (same as w4) to handle the 80 column limitation,
  so you may want to re-load the formatter into eclipse (and remove old formatters) 
  if you didn't do it during week 4.
